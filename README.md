# Embedded-project-course


In this project, I had made a small bluetooth device to monitoring environment sensing like: Sound loudness, temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality...
After that, a rasperry pi 4B was used as a BLE gateway to receive data from the device and using MQTT to publish and vizualize the data using Node-Red.
